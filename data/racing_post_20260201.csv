2026-02-01,Willie Mullins is going so badly he might yet have the favourite for all eight of the DRF Grade 1s,https://www.racingpost.com/news/opinion/comment/willie-mullins-is-going-so-badly-he-might-yet-have-the-favourite-for-all-eight-of-the-drf-grade-1s-aKqdM7h8gFmf/,"We are nine months into the jumps season and things could not be going much worse for Willie Mullins.
He has never been so far behind Gordon Elliott in the trainers' championship at this stage of the campaign, Dan Skelton is setting a massive target for the title-holder to aim at in Britain and his jockey Paul Townend's quest to retain his crown was dead in the water before the turn of the year.
State Man is out, Galopin Des Champs has been beaten at Leopardstown, Il Etait Temps capitulated at Ascot, the trainer managed just the 11 winners over Christmas and couldn't even get one around in the Thyestes. Not one Closutton horse trades at single-figure odds for the Supreme Novices' Hurdle and Mullins doesn't even have one entry in the Grade 2 bumper at Leopardstown on Saturday.
